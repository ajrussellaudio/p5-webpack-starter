# [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) & webpack

I got P5 and webpack working together and I'm pushing it so I can remind myself how to do it later.

I'm not sure if this is the best way to do it, because it works by attaching the P5 `setup()` and `draw()` methods to `window`, which seems kinda sucky to me, but I guess that's what happens when you pull P5 in through a `<script>` tag. So whatever. It works.
